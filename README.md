## Minimal Game Framework

The *"Minimal Game Framework"* (or short *Mgf* with an uppercase "M") as the name suggests, is a very small and minimal framework to build 2D-Arcade-Games from Pong till Pac-Man.

The framework is build on the standard library of "Java SE 6" and should run under both the JDK/JRE and the OpenJDK/IcedTea. No other libraries are used.

### Game List

A small list of games which where created using *Mgf*:

* [Pacman](https://bitbucket.org/LukasKnuth/pacman)

If you created a game yourself and it is a public, OpenSourced project, you can add your game (with link) to this list and send me a pull-request.
