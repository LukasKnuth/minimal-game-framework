No other libraries are used.\r\n\r\nIt can be used to create small to medium sized games and uses the Swing window-toolkit for the visual representation.\r\n\r\n### Game List\r\n\r\nA small list of games which where created using *Mgf*:\r\n\r\n* [Pacman](https://bitbucket.org/LukasKnuth/pacman)\r\n\r\nIf you created a game yourself and it is a public, OpenSourced project, you can add your game (with link) to this list and send me a pull-request.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Repository\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this framework is to be minimal (only offer very basic functionality), things are kept as abstract as possible.\r\n\r\nSince actual implementations of the offered interfaces should not go into the framework itself, we have (or will in the future) provide a kind of \"repository\" for example implementations and other helpful examples which might be usable in your project, too.\r\n\r\nExamples for such implementations include:\r\n\r\n* A basic \"figure\"-class, implementing the standard listeners and default functions (like \"getWidth()\")\r\n* CollisionTest implementations for round/square/complex objects\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* Lukas Knuth (Main Developer)\r\n* Fabian Bottler (Contributor)\r\n\r\nTo contribute to this project, just fork the project here on GitHub, do your work offline, commit to your copy and send me a pull-request. More information on that are available [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project).\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n\r\n* Tutorials on certain aspects (like collision detection, square and circle)\r\n* Give control over repaint-count (calculate rate vs. fixed rate)\r\n\r\n* Ship out v.1, create tag, create \"dev\"-branch\r\n* Setup the website with github-pages and blogposts as \"changelog\" with rss.","name":"Minimal-game-framework","note":"Don't delete this file!
